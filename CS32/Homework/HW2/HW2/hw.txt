Using the stack we search in a particular direction, till that direction ends. Which can be
seen  in the list as the stack searches in the eastern direction, relative to where we 
started. It does this till it cant go East anymore than chooses another direction to 
explore, till we get to our destination or when we run out of moves.

The queue maintains order throughout the search.  It does not wander off like the stack does, 
instead it searches each and every position in their respective order.  Which can be seen in 
the code, it searches North, East, South west, then it takes the North position and inspects
everything there, so on and so forth.  If we think of it as a tree, the queue will 
search everything in the roots, then everything in the base, and finally everything in the 
branches  till we find our destination.
