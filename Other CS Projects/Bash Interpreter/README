The current project correctly outputs left association through manually 
correcting the Parse tree,  It can successfully take in subshells too, which were not tested in test-p-ok.  The program functions successfully in the two test files.

I do, however, recieve seg faults for certain input specifically ANDOR; ANDOR; ANDOR;

The extra semi colon triggers another sequence command, further investigation required.

This will need to be corrected in a future build, as well as more detailed information about errors.

Also tried to make it more object oriented using function pointers and the like.
//1B///

In this Update, we now have an execution model, there is a bit of confusion about file descriptors, able to chain multiple pipelines, only realy problem this part was debugging multiple processes, never got the full hang of it.

//1C//

I've implemented my version parallelized code, it preprocesses the compelete command and identifies depndencies, the unique part it treats flags as reads from files

I've also gone ahead and fixed some of the parsing functionality, as well as deleted some redundant functions
I know the code isnt the cleanest, If there are any questions, and if there is any feedback youd like to give me, please let me know, I want to know what i could do better.

Thanks for all your help
